Abstract

The black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, has garnered significant attention recently due to its potential applications in waste management, animal feed production, frass fertilizer production, and biotechnology. Despite its numerous advantages, genomic resources for BSF remain limited, underscoring the necessity for continued genomic exploration. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the genomic landscape of BSF, emphasizing the critical role of genomics in understanding its biology and optimizing its applications. We highlighted recent advancements in BSF genome sequencing, transcriptomic and proteomic studies, and the characterization of the gut microbiome, revealing its implications for BSF health and production efficiency. Additionally, we explored the genetic consequences of domestication and proposed that selective breeding programs could significantly enhance BSF traits, drawing on lessons from successful programs in livestock, crops, and other insects. We also discussed the bioinformatics resources available for BSF research on genomics and other omics data, and the genetic underpinnings of key traits such as nutritional preferences. Our review demonstrates how genomic studies can influence the effectiveness of BSFâ€™s application in waste transformation into value-added animal feed, fertilizer, and reduced ecological footprint. The challenges and opportunities in current research are highlighted. We concluded by advocating for expanded genomic efforts to fully harness the potential of this versatile insect in climate-resilient agriculture to ensure food security.
