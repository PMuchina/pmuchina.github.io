Africa experiences food insecurity driven by climate change, population growth, conflicts and macroeconomic crises. Innovative, nature-
based solutions are essential in addressing these challenges. Insects have long played critical roles in ecosystems, diets, and human culture,
with over 500 species contributing significantly to food and nutrition security across the continent. However, it is only recently that insects
have been considered as a novel ‘livestock’ in food systems. Research and innovation have surged, fostering a thriving public-private sector.
Insects, particularly species relevant to farming, efficiently transform organic residual streams into high-value products. Therefore, insects
hold significant potential for sustainability, circular bioeconomy and livelihood improvement. This conference focuses on how insects can con-
tribute to transforming food systems, emphasizing the unique opportunities and challenges in Africa.
