### Short bio

I am a dedicated bioinformatician passionate about exploring genetic diversity and population genomics. My current research focuses on unravelling the genetic diversity and population structure of the black soldier fly, a project that combines my love for genomics with my expertise in bioinformatics. I am deeply fascinated by the power of programming and Linux, leveraging these tools to solve complex biological questions. My work aims to contribute to our understanding of genetic variations and their implications for species adaptation and evolution.

Currently, I am based at **Aarhus University**, where I focus on **population and evolutionary genomics**, using high-throughput sequencing data to investigate questions around genetic diversity, demographic history, and adaptation. My recent work explores the global genomic structure of black soldier flies (Hermetia illucens), an emerging species in the circular bioeconomy.

My academic background includes training in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and programming.

I am especially interested in:

- Genome evolution in natural and domesticated populations
- Demographic history and population structure from whole-genome data
- Computational tools for reproducible bioinformatics
- Applications of genomics in sustainability and agriculture
