### Short bio

I am a bioinformatician specializing in the integration and analysis of large-scale genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets. My work combines advanced programming, high-performance computing, and statistical modeling to address questions in evolutionary biology, species adaptation, and translational research.

Currently at Aarhus University, I lead genomic analyses in population and evolutionary genomics, including global studies of the black soldier flyâ€™s genetic diversity, demographic history, and adaptation. Beyond my focal species, I am passionate about applying multi-omics frameworks to understand complex biological systems and inform applications in sustainability, agriculture, and human health.

Core Interests:

1. Genome evolution in wild, domesticated, and disease contexts

2. Demographic history and population structure from whole-genome data

3. Multi-omics integration for biomarker and target discovery

4. Reproducible and scalable bioinformatics pipeline development
